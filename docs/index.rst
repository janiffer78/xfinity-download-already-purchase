Best Practices for Managing Downloads 🧠
---------------------------------------

- **Label Downloads** – Keep track of what you’ve downloaded so you don’t duplicate.  
- **Use Wi-Fi Only** – Avoid large downloads on mobile data unless necessary.

- **Keep App Updated** – Ensure the Xfinity Stream app is updated to avoid download glitches.  
- **Use Download Settings** – Choose quality options like SD or HD based on available space.  

These habits make your downloaded content more accessible and manageable. 🧹

Can You Download Rentals? 🛑
---------------------------

One common question is whether you can download rented movies or shows. Unfortunately, **Xfinity only allows downloads for purchases**, not rentals. Rentals are available for streaming during a limited time window but cannot be saved offline.

If you’re unsure whether a title is a purchase or a rental, check your billing history or look for the download icon — rentals will not have this option. 🎞️

How Long Can You Keep Downloaded Purchases? ⏳
----------------------------------------------

Once downloaded, **Xfinity purchased content** stays on your device until you delete it. There's no expiration, and you can download it again later if needed — as long as you still have an active account and the content remains licensed by Xfinity.

Even if you delete the app or switch devices, your **purchase history stays tied to your account**. Just sign in again and redownload your titles when you're ready. 🔄

Using Multiple Devices with the Same Purchases 🔁
------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can download your Xfinity purchases on more than one mobile device. However, some restrictions may apply depending on content licenses and device limits.

To stay within limits:

- Use your main devices for downloads.  
- Remove old downloads from unused devices.  
- Keep track of how many devices are linked to your account.

This way, you can continue enjoying your favorite shows without hitting a limit. 📊

What to Do If a Purchased Title Disappears 🚫
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes, a purchased title might not appear in your library due to:

- Licensing expirations  
- Account changes  
- App glitches

If this happens:

- Check your billing history to confirm the purchase  
- Try restoring purchases from app settings  
- Contact support with your account details and the title name

Xfinity can typically re-verify your purchase and restore it to your account. 🧾
